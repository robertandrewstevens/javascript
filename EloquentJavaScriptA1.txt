More (obscure) control structures / control
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In \\cbasics, a number of control statements were introduced, such as
|while|, |for|, and |break|. To keep things simple, I left out some
others, which, in my experience, are a lot less useful. This appendix
briefly describes these missing control statements.

---

First, there is _|do|_. |do| works like |while|, but instead of
executing the loop body zero or more times, it executes it one or more
times. A |do| loop looks like this:

> do {
>   var answer = prompt("Say 'moo'.", "");
>   print("You said '", answer, "'.");
> } while (answer != "moo");

To emphasise the fact that the condition is only checked *after* the
loop has run once, it is written at the end of the loop's body.

---

Next, there is _|continue|_. This one is closely related to |break|,
and can be used in the same places. While |break| jumps *out* of a
loop and causes the program to proceed after the loop, |continue|
jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

> for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
>   if (i % 3 != 0)
>     continue;
>   print(i, " is divisible by three.");
> }

A similar effect can usually be produced using just |if|, but there
are cases where |continue| looks nicer.

---

When there is a loop sitting inside another loop, a |break| or
|continue| statement will affect only the inner loop. Sometimes you
want to jump out of the *outer* loop. To be able to refer to a
specific loop, loop statements can be _label_led. A label is a name
(any valid variable name will do), followed by a colon (|:|).

> outer: for (var sideA = 1; sideA < 10; sideA++) {
>   inner: for (var sideB = 1; sideB < 10; sideB++) {
>     var hypotenuse = Math.sqrt(sideA * sideA + sideB * sideB);
>     if (hypotenuse % 1 == 0) {
>       print("A right triangle with straight sides of length ",
>             sideA, " and ", sideB, " has a hypotenuse of ",
>             hypotenuse, ".");
>       break outer;
>     }
>   }
> }

---

Next, there is a construct called _|switch|_ which can be used to
choose which code to execute based on some value. This is a very
useful thing to do, but the syntax JavaScript uses for this (which it
took from the C programming language) is so clumsy and ugly that I
usually prefer to use a chain of |if| statements instead.

> function weatherAdvice(weather) {
>   switch(weather) {
>     case "rainy":
>       print("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
>       break;
>     case "sunny":
>       print("Dress lightly.");
>     case "cloudy":
>       print("Go outside.");
>       break;
>     default:
>       print("Unknown weather type: ", weather);
>       break;
>   }
> }
>
> weatherAdvice("sunny");

Inside the block opened by |switch|, you can write a number of |case|
labels. The program will jump to the label that corresponds to the
value that |switch| was given (comparing the values with an equivalent
of |===|, so without automatic type conversion), or to |default| if no
matching value is found. Then it start executing statements there, and
*continues* past other labels, until it reaches a |break| statement.
In some cases, such as the |"sunny"| case in the example, this can be
used to share some code between cases (it recommends going outside for
both sunny and cloudy weather). Most of the time, this just adds a lot
of ugly |break| statements, or causes problems when you forget to add
one.

Like loops, |switch| statements can be given a label.

---

Finally, there is a keyword named _|with|_. I've never actually *used*
this in a real program, but I have seen other people use it, so it is
useful to know what it is. Code using |with| looks like this:

> var scope = "outside";
> var object = {name: "Ignatius", scope: "inside"};
> with(object) {
>   print("Name == ", name, ", scope == ", scope);
>   name = "Raoul";
>   var newVariable = 49;
> }
> show(object.name);
> show(newVariable);

Inside the block, the properties of the object given to |with| act as
variables. Newly introduced variables are *not* added as properties to
this object though. I assume the idea behind this construct was that
it could be useful in methods that make lots of use of the properties
of their object. You could start such a method with |with(this)
{...}|, and not have to write |this| all the time after that.
