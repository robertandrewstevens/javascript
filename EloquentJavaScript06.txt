Functional Programming / fp
===========================

As programs get bigger, they also become more complex and harder to
understand. We all think ourselves pretty clever, of course, but we
are mere human beings, and even a moderate amount of chaos tends to
baffle us. And then it all goes downhill. Working on something you do
not really understand is a bit like cutting random wires on those
time-activated bombs they always have in movies. If you are lucky, you
might get the right one -- especially if you are the hero of the movie
and strike a suitably dramatic pose -- but there is always the
possibility of blowing everything up.

Admittedly, in most cases, breaking a program does not cause any large
explosions. But when a program, by someone's ignorant tinkering, has
degenerated into a ramshackle mass of errors, reshaping it into
something sensible is a terrible labour -- sometimes you might just as
well start over.

@_abstraction_Thus, the programmer is always looking for ways to keep
the complexity of his programs as low as possible. An important way to
do this is to try and make code more abstract. When writing a program,
it is easy to get sidetracked into small details at every point. You
come across some little issue, and you deal with it, and then proceed
to the next little problem, and so on. This makes the code read like a
grandmother's tale.

| Yes, dear, to make pea soup you will need split peas, the dry kind.
| And you have to soak them at least for a night, or you will have to
| cook them for hours and hours. I remember one time, when my dull son
| tried to make pea soup. Would you believe he hadn't soaked the peas?
| We almost broke our teeth, all of us. Anyway, when you have soaked
| the peas, and you'll want about a cup of them per person, and pay
| attention because they will expand a bit while they are soaking, so
| if you aren't careful they will spill out of whatever you use to
| hold them, so also use plenty water to soak in, but as I said, about
| a cup of them, when they are dry, and after they are soaked you cook
| them in four cups of water per cup of dry peas. Let it simmer for
| two hours, which means you cover it and keep it barely cooking, and
| then add some diced onions, sliced celery stalk, and maybe a carrot
| or two and some ham. Let it all cook for a few minutes more, and it
| is ready to eat.

Another way to describe this recipe:

| Per person: one cup dried split peas, half a chopped onion, half a
| carrot, a celery stalk, and optionally ham.
|
| Soak peas overnight, simmer them for two hours in four cups of water
| (per person), add vegetables and ham, and cook for ten more minutes.

This is shorter, but if you don't know how to soak peas you'll surely
screw up and put them in too little water. But how to soak peas can be
looked up, and that is the trick. If you assume a certain basic
knowledge in the audience, you can talk in a language that deals with
bigger concepts, and express things in a much shorter and clearer way.
This, more or less, is what abstraction is.

How is this far-fetched recipe story relevant to programming? Well,
obviously, the recipe is the program. Furthermore, the basic knowledge
that the cook is supposed to have corresponds to the functions and
other constructs that are available to the programmer. If you remember
the introduction of this book, things like |while| make it easier to
build loops, and in \\cdata we wrote some simple functions in order to
make other functions shorter and more straightforward. Such tools,
some of them made available by the language itself, others built by
the programmer, are used to reduce the amount of uninteresting details
in the rest of the program, and thus make that program easier to work
with.

---

@_functional programming_Functional programming, which is the subject
of this chapter, produces abstraction through clever ways of combining
functions. A programmer armed with a repertoire of fundamental
functions and, more importantly, the knowledge on how to use them, is
much more effective than one who starts from scratch. Unfortunately, a
standard JavaScript environment comes with deplorably few essential
functions, so we have to write them ourselves or, which is often
preferable, make use of somebody else's code (more on that in
\\cmodularity).

There are other popular approaches to abstraction, most notably
object-oriented programming, the subject of \\coo.

---

One ugly detail that, if you have any good taste at all, must be
starting to bother you is the endlessly repeated |for| loop going over
an array: |for (var i = 0; i < something.length; i++) ...|. Can this
be abstracted?

The problem is that, whereas most functions just take some values,
combine them, and return something, such a loop contains a piece of
code that it must execute. It is easy to write a function that goes
over an array and prints out every element:

> function printArray(array) {
>   for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
>     print(array[i]);
> }

But what if we want to do something else than print? Since 'doing
something' can be represented as a function, and functions are also
values, we can pass our action as a function value:

> function forEach(array, action) {
>   for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
>     action(array[i]);
> }
>
> forEach(["Wampeter", "Foma", "Granfalloon"], print);

And by making use of an anonymous function, something just like a
|for| loop can be written with less useless details:

> function sum(numbers) {
>   var total = 0;
>   forEach(numbers, function (number) {
>     total += number;
>   });
>   return total;
> }
> show(sum([1, 10, 100]));

Note that the variable |total| is visible inside the anonymous
function because of the lexical scoping rules. Also note that this
version is hardly shorter than the |for| loop and requires a rather
clunky |});| at its end -- the brace closes the body of the anonymous
function, the parenthesis closes the function call to _|forEach|_, and
the semicolon is needed because this call is a statement.

You do get a variable bound to the current element in the array,
|number|, so there is no need to use |numbers[i]| anymore, and when
this array is created by evaluating some expression, there is no need
to store it in a variable, because it can be passed to |forEach|
directly.

The cat-code in \\cdata contains a piece like this:

] var paragraphs = mailArchive[mail].split("\n");
] for (var i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++)
]   handleParagraph(paragraphs[i]);

This can now be written as...

] forEach(mailArchive[mail].split("\n"), handleParagraph);

On the whole, using more abstract (or 'higher level') constructs
results in more information and less noise: The code in |sum| reads
'*for each number in numbers add that number to the total*', instead
of... '*there is this variable that starts at zero, and it counts
upward to the length of the array called numbers, and for every value
of this variable we look up the corresponding element in the array and
add this to the total*'.

---

What |forEach| does is take an algorithm, in this case 'going over an
array', and abstract it. The 'gaps' in the algorithm, in this case,
what to do for each of these elements, are filled by functions which
are passed to the algorithm function.

Functions that operate on other functions are called _higher-order
function_s. By operating on functions, they can talk about actions on
a whole new level. The |makeAddFunction| function from \\cfunctions is
also a higher-order function. Instead of taking a function value as an
argument, it produces a new function.

Higher-order functions can be used to generalise many algorithms that
regular functions can not easily describe. When you have a repertoire
of these functions at your disposal, it can help you think about your
code in a clearer way: Instead of a messy set of variables and loops,
you can decompose algorithms into a combination of a few fundamental
algorithms, which are invoked by name, and do not have to be typed out
again and again.

Being able to write *what* we want to do instead of *how* we do it
means we are working at a higher level of abstraction. In practice,
this means shorter, clearer, and more pleasant code.

---

Another useful type of higher-order function *modifies* the function
value it is given:

> function negate(func) {
>   return function(x) {
>     return !func(x);
>   };
> }
> var isNotNaN = negate(isNaN);
> show(isNotNaN(NaN));

The function returned by |negate| feeds the argument it is given to
the original function |func|, and then negates the result. But what if
the function you want to negate takes more than one argument? You can
get access to any arguments passed to a function with the |arguments|
array, but how do you call a function when you do not know how many
arguments you have?

Functions have a method called _|apply|_, which is used for situations
like this. It takes two arguments. The role of the first argument will
be discussed in \\coo, for now we just use |null| there. The second
argument is an array containing the arguments that the function must
be applied to.

> show(Math.min.apply(null, [5, 6]));
>
> function negate(func) {
>   return function() {
>     return !func.apply(null, arguments);
>   };
> }

Unfortunately, on the Internet Explorer browser a lot of built-in
functions, such as |alert|, are not *really* functions... or
something. They report their type as |"object"| when given to the
|typeof| operator, and they do not have an |apply| method. Your own
functions do not suffer from this, they are always real functions.

---

Let us look at a few more basic algorithms related to arrays. The
|sum| function is really a variant of an algorithm which is usually
called _|reduce|_ or |fold|:

> function reduce(combine, base, array) {
>   forEach(array, function (element) {
>     base = combine(base, element);
>   });
>   return base;
> }
>
> function add(a, b) {
>   return a + b;
> }
>
> function sum(numbers) {
>   return reduce(add, 0, numbers);
> }

|reduce| combines an array into a single value by repeatedly using a
function that combines an element of the array with a base value. This
is exactly what |sum| did, so it can be made shorter by using
|reduce|... except that addition is an operator and not a function in
JavaScript, so we first had to put it into a function.

The reason |reduce| takes the function as its first argument instead
of its last, as in |forEach|, is partly that this is tradition --
other languages do it like that -- and partly that this allows us to
use a particular trick, which will be discussed at the end of this
chapter. It does mean that, when calling |reduce|, writing the
reducing function as an anonymous function looks a bit weirder,
because now the other arguments follow after the function, and the
resemblance to a normal |for| block is lost entirely.

***

Write a function |countZeroes|, which takes an array of numbers as its
argument and returns the amount of zeroes that occur in it. Use
|reduce|.

Then, write the higher-order function |count|, which takes an array
and a test function as arguments, and returns the amount of elements
in the array for which the test function returned |true|. Re-implement
|countZeroes| using this function.

///

> function countZeroes(array) {
>   function counter(total, element) {
>     return total + (element === 0 ? 1 : 0);
>   }
>   return reduce(counter, 0, array);
> }

@_|?:|_The weird part, with the question mark and the colon, uses a
new operator. In \\cbasics we have seen unary and binary operators.
This one is ternary -- it acts on three values. Its effect resembles
that of |if|/|else|, except that, where |if| conditionally executes
statements, this one conditionally chooses expressions. The first
part, before the question mark, is the condition. If this condition is
|true|, the expression after the question mark is chosen, |1| in this
case. If it is |false|, the part after the colon, |0| in this case, is
chosen.

Use of this operator can make some pieces of code much shorter. When
the expressions inside it get very big, or you have to make more
decisions inside the conditional parts, just using plain |if| and
|else| is usually more readable.

Here is the solution that uses a |count| function, with a function
that produces equality-testers included to make the final
|countZeroes| function even shorter:

> function count(test, array) {
>   return reduce(function(total, element) {
>     return total + (test(element) ? 1 : 0);
>   }, 0, array);
> }
>
> function equals(x) {
>   return function(element) {return x === element;};
> }
>
> function countZeroes(array) {
>   return count(equals(0), array);
> }

---

One other generally useful 'fundamental algorithm' related to arrays
is called _|map|_. It goes over an array, applying a function to every
element, just like |forEach|. But instead of discarding the values
returned by function, it builds up a new array from these values.

> function map(func, array) {
>   var result = [];
>   forEach(array, function (element) {
>     result.push(func(element));
>   });
>   return result;
> }
>
> show(map(Math.round, [0.01, 2, 9.89, Math.PI]));

Note that the first argument is called |func|, not |function|, this
is because |function| is a keyword and thus not a valid variable name.

There once was, living in the deep mountain forests of Transylvania, a
recluse. Most of the time, he just wandered around his mountain,
talking to trees and laughing with birds. But now and then, when the
pouring rain trapped him in his little hut, and the howling wind made
him feel unbearably small, the recluse felt an urge to write
something, wanted to pour some thoughts out onto paper, where they
could maybe grow bigger than he himself was.

After failing miserably at poetry, fiction, and philosophy, the
recluse finally decided to write a technical book. In his youth, he
had done some computer programming, and he figured that if he could
just write a good book about that, fame and recognition would surely
follow.

So he wrote. At first he used fragments of tree bark, but that turned
out not to be very practical. He went down to the nearest village and
bought himself a laptop computer. After a few chapters, he realised he
wanted to put the book in HTML format, in order to put it on his
web-page...

---

Are you familiar with HTML? It is the method used to add mark-up to
pages on the web, and we will be using it a few times in this book, so
it would be nice if you know how it works, at least generally. If you
are a good student, you could go search the web for a good
introduction to HTML now, and come back here when you have read it.
Most of you probably are lousy students, so I will just give a short
explanation and hope it is enough.

_HTML_ stands for 'HyperText Mark-up Language'. An HTML document is
all text. Because it must be able to express the structure of this
text, information about which text is a heading, which text is purple,
and so on, a few characters have a special meaning, somewhat like
backslashes in JavaScript strings. The 'less than' and 'greater than'
characters are used to create '_tag_s'. A tag gives extra information
about the text in the document. It can stand on its own, for example
to mark the place where a picture should appear in the page, or it can
contain text and other tags, for example when it marks the start and
end of a paragraph.

Some tags are compulsory, a whole HTML document must always be
contained in between |html| tags. Here is an example of an HTML
document:

] <html>
]   <head>
]     <title>A quote</title>
]   </head>
]   <body>
]     <h1>A quote</h1>
]     <blockquote>
]       <p>The connection between the language in which we
]       think/program and the problems and solutions we can imagine
]       is very close.  For this reason restricting language
]       features with the intent of eliminating programmer errors is
]       at best dangerous.</p>
]       <p>-- Bjarne Stroustrup</p>
]     </blockquote>
]     <p>Mr. Stroustrup is the inventor of the C++ programming
]     language, but quite an insightful person nevertheless.</p>
]     <p>Also, here is a picture of an ostrich:</p>
]     <img src="img/ostrich.png"/>
]   </body>
] </html>

Elements that contain text or other tags are first opened with
|<tagname>|, and afterwards finished with |</tagname>|. The |html|
element always contains two children: |head| and |body|. The first
contains information *about* the document, the second contains the
actual document.

Most tag names are cryptic abbreviations. |h1| stands for 'heading 1',
the biggest kind of heading. There are also |h2| to |h6| for
successively smaller headings. |p| means 'paragraph', and |img| stands
for 'image'. The |img| element does not contain any text or other
tags, but it does have some extra information,
|src="img/ostrich.png"|, which is called an '_attribute_'. In this
case, it contains information about the image file that should be
shown here.

Because |<| and |>| have a special meaning in HTML documents, they can
not be written directly in the text of the document. If you want to
say '|5 < 10|' in an HTML document, you have to write '|5 &lt; 10|',
where '|lt|' stands for 'less than'. '|&gt;|' is used for '|>|', and
because these codes also give the ampersand character a special
meaning, a plain '|&|' is written as '|&amp;|'.

Now, those are only the bare basics of HTML, but they should be enough
to make it through this chapter, and later chapters that deal with
HTML documents, without getting entirely confused.

---

The JavaScript console has a function |viewHTML| that can be used to
look at HTML documents. I stored the example document above in the
variable |stroustrupQuote|, so you can view it by executing the
following code:

> viewHTML(stroustrupQuote);

If you have some kind of pop-up blocker installed or integrated in
your browser, it will probably interfere with |viewHTML|, which tries
to show the HTML document in a new window or tab. Try to configure the
blocker to allow pop-ups from this site.

---

So, picking up the story again, the recluse wanted to have his book in
HTML format. At first he just wrote all the tags directly into his
manuscript, but typing all those less-than and greater-than signs made
his fingers hurt, and he constantly forgot to write |&amp;| when he
needed an |&|. This gave him a headache. Next, he tried to write the
book in Microsoft Word, and then save it as HTML. But the HTML that
came out of that was fifteen times bigger and more complicated than it
had to be. And besides, Microsoft Word gave him a headache.

The solution that he eventually came up with was this: He would write
the book as plain text, following some simple rules about the way
paragraphs were separated and the way headings looked. Then, he would
write a program to convert this text into precisely the HTML that he
wanted.

The rules are this:

 1. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
 2. A paragraph that starts with a '%' symbol is a header. The more '%' symbols, the smaller the header.
 3. Inside paragraphs, pieces of text can be emphasised by putting them between asterisks.
 4. Footnotes are written between braces.

---

After he had struggled painfully with his book for six months, the
recluse had still only finished a few paragraphs. At this point, his
hut was struck by lightning, killing him, and forever putting his
writing ambitions to rest. From the charred remains of his laptop, I
could recover the following file:

] % The Book of Programming
] 
] %% The Two Aspects
] 
] Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,
] it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
] regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
] essence stays invisibly below.
] 
] When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
] memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.
] 
] The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called
] Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
] called Data.
] 
] Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
] consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
] tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.
] 
] The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
] proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
] other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
] Data and Control.
] 
] Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers
] of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
] the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
] Control was restricted into control structures and functions.
] 
] %% Short Sayings
] 
] When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle of Data and
] Control, Fu-Tzu replied 'Think of a compiler, compiling itself.'
] 
] A student asked 'The programmers of old used only simple machines and
] no programming languages, yet they made beautiful programs. Why do we
] use complicated machines and programming languages?'. Fu-Tzu replied
] 'The builders of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made
] beautiful huts.'
] 
] A hermit spent ten years writing a program. 'My program can compute
] the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running MS DOS', he proudly
] announced. 'Nobody owns a 286-computer or uses MS DOS anymore.',
] Fu-Tzu responded.
] 
] Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global state and
] dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked 'You warned us against
] these techniques, yet I find them in your program. How can this be?'
] Fu-Tzu said 'There is no need to fetch a water hose when the house is
] not on fire.'{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy
] programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic adherence to
] rules of thumb.}
] 
] %% Wisdom
] 
] A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root
] of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.
] Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed. 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down
] the precise value of the square root of two for me.'
] 
] Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
] is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
] is needed.'
] 
] Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
] programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting
] comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a *million* lines
] already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'
] Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.
] 
] A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
] frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
] difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
] him on the back of his head and shouted '*Type something!*' The student
] started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
] understood the beautiful solution.
] 
] %% Progression
] 
] A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her
] hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.
] His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but
] growing too big they fall apart{Referring to the danger of internal
] inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.
] 
] Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of
] time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly
] structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must
] change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that
] structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.
] 
] The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave
] things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet
] malleable.
] 
] %% Language
] 
] When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and
] semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics
] describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics
] are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is
] clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble
] bush.
] 
] Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,
] which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as
] he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day
] he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu
] listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying 'Every language
] has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you
] were using another language.'

---

To honour the memory of our good recluse, I would like to finish his
HTML-generating program for him. A good approach to this problem goes
like this:

 1. Split the file into paragraphs by cutting it at every empty line.
 2. Remove the '%' characters from header paragraphs and mark them as headers.
 3. Process the text of the paragraphs themselves, splitting them into normal parts, emphasised parts, and footnotes.
 4. Move all the footnotes to the bottom of the document, leaving numbers## in their place.
 5. Wrap each piece into the correct HTML tags.
 6. Combine everything into a single HTML document.

## Like this...

This approach does not allow footnotes inside emphasised text, or vice
versa. This is kind of arbitrary, but helps keep the example code
simple. If, at the end of the chapter, you feel like an extra
challenge, you can try to revise the program to support 'nested'
mark-up.

The whole manuscript, as a string value, is available on this page
by calling |recluseFile| function.

---

Step 1 of the algorithm is trivial. A blank line is what you get when
you have two newlines in a row, and if you remember the |split| method
that strings have, which we saw in \\cdata, you will realise that this
will do the trick:

> var paragraphs = recluseFile().split("\n\n");
> print("Found ", paragraphs.length, " paragraphs.");

***

Write a function |processParagraph| that, when given a paragraph
string as its argument, checks whether this paragraph is a header. If
it is, it strips off the '%' characters and counts their number. Then,
it returns an object with two properties, |content|, which contains
the text inside the paragraph, and |type|, which contains the tag that
this paragraph must be wrapped in, |"p"| for regular paragraphs,
|"h1"| for headers with one '%', and |"hX"| for headers with |X| '%'
characters.

Remember that strings have a |charAt| method that can be used to look
at a specific character inside them.

///

> function processParagraph(paragraph) {
>   var header = 0;
>   while (paragraph.charAt(0) == "%") {
>     paragraph = paragraph.slice(1);
>     header++;
>   }
>
>   return {type: (header == 0 ? "p" : "h" + header),
>           content: paragraph};
> }
>
> show(processParagraph(paragraphs[0]));

---

This is where we can try out the |map| function we saw earlier.

> var paragraphs = map(processParagraph,
>                      recluseFile().split("\n\n"));

And *bang*, we have an array of nicely categorised paragraph objects.
We are getting ahead of ourselves though, we forgot step 3 of the
algorithm:

| Process the text of the paragraphs themselves, splitting them into
| normal parts, emphasised parts, and footnotes.

Which can be decomposed into:

 1. If the paragraph starts with an asterisk, take off the emphasised part and store it.
 2. If the paragraph starts with an opening brace, take off the footnote and store it.
 3. Otherwise, take off the part until the first emphasised part or footnote, or until the end of the string, and store it as normal text.
 4. If there is anything left in the paragraph, start at 1 again.

***

Build a function |splitParagraph| which, given a paragraph string,
returns an array of paragraph fragments. Think of a good way to
represent the fragments.

The method |indexOf|, which searches for a character or sub-string in
a string and returns its position, or |-1| if not found, will probably
be useful in some way here.

This is a tricky algorithm, and there are many not-quite-correct or
way-too-long ways to describe it. If you run into problems, just think
about it for a minute. Try to write inner functions that perform the
smaller actions that make up the algorithm.

///

Here is one possible solution:

> function splitParagraph(text) {
>   function indexOrEnd(character) {
>     var index = text.indexOf(character);
>     return index == -1 ? text.length : index;
>   }
>
>   function takeNormal() {
>     var end = reduce(Math.min, text.length,
>                      map(indexOrEnd, ["*", "{"]));
>     var part = text.slice(0, end);
>     text = text.slice(end);
>     return part;
>   }
>
>   function takeUpTo(character) {
>     var end = text.indexOf(character, 1);

Note the over-eager use of |map| and |reduce| in the |takeNormal|
function. This is a chapter about functional programming, so program
functionally we will! Can you see how this works? The |map| produces
an array of positions where the given characters were found, or the
end of the string if they were not found, and the |reduce| takes the
minimum of them, which is the next point in the string that we have to
look at.

If you'd write that out without mapping and reducing you'd get
something like this:

] var nextAsterisk = text.indexOf("*");
] var nextBrace = text.indexOf("{");
] var end = text.length;
] if (nextAsterisk != -1)
]   end = nextAsterisk;
] if (nextBrace != -1 && nextBrace < end)
]   end = nextBrace;

Which is even more hideous. Most of the time, when a decision has to
be made based on a series of things, even if there are only two of
them, writing it as array operations is nicer than handling every
value in a separate |if| statement. (Fortunately, \\cregexp describes
an easier way to ask for the first occurrence of 'this or that
character' in a string.)

If you wrote a |splitParagraph| that stored fragments in a different
way than the solution above, you might want to adjust it, because the
functions in the rest of the chapter assume that fragments are objects
with |type| and |content| properties.

---

We can now wire |processParagraph| to also split the text inside the
paragraphs, my version can be modified like this:

> function processParagraph(paragraph) {
>   var header = 0;
>   while (paragraph.charAt(0) == "%") {
>     paragraph = paragraph.slice(1);
>     header++;
>   }
>
>   return {type: (header == 0 ? "p" : "h" + header),
>           content: splitParagraph(paragraph)};
> }

Mapping that over the array of paragraphs gives us an array of
paragraph objects, which in turn contain arrays of fragment objects.
The next thing to do is to take out the footnotes, and put references
to them in their place. Something like this:

> function extractFootnotes(paragraphs) {
>   var footnotes = [];
>   var currentNote = 0;
>
>   function replaceFootnote(fragment) {
>     if (fragment.type == "footnote") {
>       currentNote++;
>       footnotes.push(fragment);
>       fragment.number = currentNote;
>       return {type: "reference", number: currentNote};
>     }
>     else {
>       return fragment;
>     }
>   }
>
>   forEach(paragraphs, function(paragraph) {
>     paragraph.content = map(replaceFootnote,
>                             paragraph.content);
>   });
>
>   return footnotes;
> }     

The |replaceFootnote| function is called on every fragment. When it
gets a fragment that should stay where it is, it just returns it, but
when it gets a footnote, it stores this footnote in the |footnotes|
array, and returns a reference to it instead. In the process, every
footnote and reference is also numbered.

---

That gives us enough tools to extract the information we need from the
file. All that is left now is generating the correct HTML.

A lot of people think that concatenating strings is a great way to
produce HTML. When they need a link to, for example, a site where you
can play the game of Go, they will do:

> var url = "http://www.gokgs.com/";
> var text = "Play Go!";
> var linkText = "<a href=\"" + url + "\">" + text + "</a>";
> print(linkText);

(Where |a| is the tag used to create links in HTML documents.) ... Not
only is this clumsy, but when the string |text| happens to include an
angular bracket or an ampersand, it is also wrong. Weird things will
happen on your website, and you will look embarrassingly amateurish.
We wouldn't want that to happen. A few simple HTML-generating
functions are easy to write. So let us write them.

---

The secret to successful HTML generation is to treat your HTML
document as a data structure instead of a flat piece of text.
JavaScript's objects provide a very easy way to model this:

> var linkObject = {name: "a",
>                   attributes: {href: "http://www.gokgs.com/"},
>                   content: ["Play Go!"]};

Each HTML element contains a |name| property, giving the name of the
tag it represents. When it has attributes, it also contains an
|attributes| property, which contains an object in which the
attributes are stored. When it has content, there is a |content|
property, containing an array of other elements contained in this
element. Strings play the role of pieces of text in our HTML document,
so the array |["Play Go!"]| means that this link has only one element
inside it, which is a simple piece of text.

Typing in these objects directly is clumsy, but we don't have to do
that. We provide a shortcut function to do this for us:

> function tag(name, content, attributes) {
>   return {name: name, attributes: attributes, content: content};
> }

Note that, since we allow the |attributes| and |content| of an element
to be undefined if they are not applicable, the second and third
argument to this function can be left off when they are not needed.

|tag| is still rather primitive, so we write shortcuts for common
types of elements, such as links, or the outer structure of a simple
document:

> function link(target, text) {
>   return tag("a", [text], {href: target});
> }
>
> function htmlDoc(title, bodyContent) {
>   return tag("html", [tag("head", [tag("title", [title])]),
>                       tag("body", bodyContent)]);
> }

***

Looking back at the example HTML document if necessary, write an
|image| function which, when given the location of an image file, will
create an |img| HTML element.

///

> function image(src) {
>   return tag("img", [], {src: src});
> }

---

When we have created a document, it will have to be reduced to a
string. But building this string from the data structures we have been
producing is very straightforward. The important thing is to remember
to transform the special characters in the text of our document...

> function escapeHTML(text) {
>   var replacements = [[/&/g, "&amp;"], [/"/g, "&quot;"],
>                       [/</g, "&lt;"], [/>/g, "&gt;"]];
>   forEach(replacements, function(replace) {
>     text = text.replace(replace[0], replace[1]);
>   });
>   return text;
> }

The |replace| method of strings creates a new string in which all
occurrences of the pattern in the first argument are replaced by the
second argument, so |"Borobudur".replace(/r/g, "k")| gives
|"Bokobuduk"|. Don't worry about the pattern syntax here -- we'll get
to that in \\cregexp. The |escapeHTML| function puts the different
replacements that have to be made into an array, so that it can loop
over them and apply them to the argument one by one.

Double quotes are also replaced, because we will also be using this
function for the text inside the attributes of HTML tags. Those will
be surrounded by double quotes, and thus must not have any double
quotes inside of them.

Calling replace four times means the computer has to go over the whole
string four times to check and replace its content. This is not very
efficient. If we cared enough, we could write a more complex version
of this function, something that resembles the |splitParagraph|
function we saw earlier, to go over it only once. For now, we are too
lazy for this. Again, \\cregexp shows a much better way to do this.

---

To turn an HTML element object into a string, we can use a recursive
function like this:

> function renderHTML(element) {
>   var pieces = [];
>
>   function renderAttributes(attributes) {
>     var result = [];
>     if (attributes) {
>       for (var name in attributes) 
>         result.push(" " + name + "=\"" +
>                     escapeHTML(attributes[name]) + "\"");
>     }
>     return result.join("");
>   }
>
>   function render(element) {
>     // Text node
>     if (typeof element == "string") {
>       pieces.push(escapeHTML(element));
>     }
>     // Empty tag
>     else if (!element.content || element.content.length == 0) {
>       pieces.push("<" + element.name +
>                   renderAttributes(element.attributes) + "/>");
>     }
>     // Tag with content
>     else {
>       pieces.push("<" + element.name +
>                   renderAttributes(element.attributes) + ">");
>       forEach(element.content, render);
>       pieces.push("</" + element.name + ">");
>     }
>   }
>
>   render(element);
>   return pieces.join("");
> }

Note the |in| loop that extracts the properties from a JavaScript
object in order to make HTML tag attributes out of them. Also note
that in two places, arrays are being used to accumulate strings, which
are then joined into a single result string. Why didn't I just start
with an empty string and then add the content to it with the |+=|
operator?

It turns out that creating new strings, especially big strings, is
quite a lot of work. Remember that JavaScript string values never
change. If you concatenate something to them, a new string is created,
the old ones stay intact. If we build up a big string by concatenating
lots of little strings, new strings have to be created at every step,
only to be thrown away when the next piece is concatenated to them.
If, on the other hand, we store all the little strings in an array and
then join them, only *one* big string has to be created.

---

So, let us try out this HTML generating system...

> print(renderHTML(link("http://www.nedroid.com", "Drawings!")));

That seems to work.

> var body = [tag("h1", ["The Test"]),
>             tag("p", ["Here is a paragraph, and an image..."]),
>             image("img/sheep.png")];
> var doc = htmlDoc("The Test", body);
> viewHTML(renderHTML(doc));

Now, I should probably warn you that this approach is not perfect.
What it actually renders is _XML_, which is similar to HTML, but more
structured. In simple cases, such as the above, this does not cause
any problems. However, there are some things, which are correct XML,
but not proper HTML, and these might confuse a browser that is trying
to show the documents we create. For example, if you have an empty
|script| tag (used to put JavaScript into a page) in your document,
browsers will not realise that it is empty and think that everything
after it is JavaScript. (In this case, the problem can be fixed by
putting a single space inside of the tag, so that it is no longer
empty, and gets a proper closing tag.)

***

Write a function |renderFragment|, and use that to implement another
function |renderParagraph|, which takes a paragraph object (with the
footnotes already filtered out), and produces the correct HTML element
(which might be a paragraph or a header, depending on the |type|
property of the paragraph object).

This function might come in useful for rendering the footnote
references:

> function footnote(number) {
>   return tag("sup", [link("#footnote" + number,
>                           String(number))]);
> }

A |sup| tag will show its content as 'superscript', which means it
will be smaller and a little higher than other text. The target of the
link will be something like |"#footnote1"|. Links that contain a '#'
character refer to 'anchors' within a page, and in this case we will
use them to make it so that clicking on the footnote link will take
the reader to the bottom of the page, where the footnotes live.

The tag to render emphasised fragments with is |em|, and normal text
can be rendered without any extra tags.

///

> function renderParagraph(paragraph) {
>   return tag(paragraph.type, map(renderFragment,
>                                  paragraph.content));
> }
>
> function renderFragment(fragment) {
>   if (fragment.type == "reference")
>     return footnote(fragment.number);
>   else if (fragment.type == "emphasised")
>     return tag("em", [fragment.content]);
>   else if (fragment.type == "normal")
>     return fragment.content;
> }

---

We are almost finished. The only thing that we do not have a rendering
function for yet are the footnotes. To make the |"#footnote1"| links
work, an anchor must be included with every footnote. In HTML, an
anchor is specified with an |a| element, which is also used for links.
In this case, it needs a |name| attribute, instead of an |href|.

> function renderFootnote(footnote) {
>   var number = "[" + footnote.number + "] ";
>   var anchor = tag("a", [number], {name: "footnote" + footnote.number});
>   return tag("p", [tag("small", [anchor, footnote.content])]);
> }

Here, then, is the function which, when given a file in the correct
format and a document title, returns an HTML document:

> function renderFile(file, title) {
>   var paragraphs = map(processParagraph, file.split("\n\n"));
>   var footnotes = map(renderFootnote,
>                       extractFootnotes(paragraphs));
>   var body = map(renderParagraph, paragraphs).concat(footnotes);
>   return renderHTML(htmlDoc(title, body));
> }
>
> viewHTML(renderFile(recluseFile(), "The Book of Programming"));

The _|concat|_ method of an array can be used to concatenate another
array to it, similar to what the |+| operator does with strings.

---

In the chapters after this one, elementary higher-order functions like
|map| and |reduce| will always be available and will be used by code
examples. Now and then, a new useful tool is added to this. In
\\cmodularity, we develop a more structured approach to this set of
'basic' functions.

---

When using higher-order functions, it is often annoying that operators
are not functions in JavaScript. We have needed |add| or |equals|
functions at several points. Rewriting these every time, you will
agree, is a pain. From now on, we will assume the existence of an
object called |op|, which contains these functions:

> var op = {
>   "+": function(a, b){return a + b;},
>   "==": function(a, b){return a == b;},
>   "===": function(a, b){return a === b;},
>   "!": function(a){return !a;}
>   /* and so on */
> };

So we can write |reduce(op["+"], 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])| to sum an array.
But what if we need something like |equals| or |makeAddFunction|, in
which one of the arguments already has a value? In that case we are
back to writing a new function again.

For cases like that, something called '_partial application_' is
useful. You want to create a new function that already knows some of
its arguments, and treats any additional arguments it is passed as
coming after these fixed arguments. This can be done by making
creative use of the |apply| method of a function:

> function asArray(quasiArray, start) {
>   var result = [];
>   for (var i = (start || 0); i < quasiArray.length; i++)
>     result.push(quasiArray[i]);
>   return result;
> }
>
> function partial(func) {
>   var fixedArgs = asArray(arguments, 1);
>   return function(){
>     return func.apply(null, fixedArgs.concat(asArray(arguments)));
>   };
> }

We want to allow binding multiple arguments at the same time, so the
|asArray| function is necessary to make normal arrays out of the
|arguments| objects. It copies their content into a real array, so
that the |concat| method can be used on it. It also takes an optional
second argument, which can be used to leave out some arguments at the
start.

Also note that it is necessary to store the |arguments| of the outer
function (|partial|) into a variable with another name, because
otherwise the inner function can not see them -- it has its own
|arguments| variable, which shadows the one of the outer function.

Now |equals(10)| could be written as |partial(op["=="], 10)|, without
the need for a specialized |equals| function. And you can do things
like this:

> show(map(partial(op["+"], 1), [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]));

The reason |map| takes its function argument before its array argument
is that it is often useful to partially apply map by giving it a
function. This 'lifts' the function from operating on a single value
to operating on an array of values. For example, if you have an array
of arrays of numbers, and you want to square them all, you do this:

> function square(x) {return x * x;}
>
> show(map(partial(map, square), [[10, 100], [12, 16], [0, 1]]));

---

One last trick that can be useful when you want to combine functions
is _function composition_. At the start of this chapter I showed a
function |negate|, which applies the boolean *not* operator to the
result of calling a function:

> function negate(func) {
>   return function() {
>     return !func.apply(null, arguments);
>   };
> }

This is a special case of a general pattern: call function A, and then
apply function B to the result. Composition is a common concept in
mathematics. @_|compose|_It can be caught in a higher-order function
like this:

> function compose(func1, func2) {
>   return function() {
>     return func1(func2.apply(null, arguments));
>   };
> }
>
> var isUndefined = partial(op["==="], undefined);
> var isDefined = compose(op["!"], isUndefined);
> show(isDefined(Math.PI));
> show(isDefined(Math.PIE));

Here we are defining new functions without using the |function|
keyword at all. This can be useful when you need to create a simple
function to give to, for example, |map| or |reduce|. However, when a
function becomes more complex than these examples, it is usually
shorter (not to mention more efficient) to just write it out with
|function|.
