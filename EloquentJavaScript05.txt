Error Handling / error
======================

Writing programs that work when everything goes as expected is a good
start. Making your programs behave properly when encountering
unexpected conditions is where it really gets challenging.

The problematic situations that a program can encounter fall into two
categories: Programmer mistakes and genuine problems. If someone
forgets to pass a required argument to a function, that is an example
of the first kind of problem. On the other hand, if a program asks the
user to enter a name and it gets back an empty string, that is
something the programmer can not prevent.

In general, one deals with programmer errors by finding and fixing
them, and with genuine errors by having the code check for them and
perform some suitable action to remedy them (for example, asking for
the name again), or at least fail in a well-defined and clean way.

---

It is important to decide into which of these categories a certain
problem falls. For example, consider our old |power| function:

> function power(base, exponent) {
>   var result = 1;
>   for (var count = 0; count < exponent; count++)
>     result *= base;
>   return result;
> }

When some geek tries to call |power("Rabbit", 4)|, that is quite
obviously a programmer error, but how about |power(9, 0.5)|? The
function can not handle fractional exponents, but, mathematically
speaking, raising a number to the halfth power is perfectly reasonable
(_|Math.pow|_ can handle it). In situations where it is not entirely
clear what kind of input a function accepts, it is often a good idea
to explicitly state the kind of arguments that are acceptable in a
comment.

---

If a function encounters a problem that it can not solve itself, what
should it do? In \\cdata we wrote the function |between|:

> function between(string, start, end) {
>   var startAt = string.indexOf(start) + start.length;
>   var endAt = string.indexOf(end, startAt);
>   return string.slice(startAt, endAt);
> }

If the given |start| and |end| do not occur in the string, |indexOf|
will return |-1| and this version of |between| will return a lot of
nonsense: |between("Your mother!", "{-", "-}")| returns |"our mother"|.

When the program is running, and the function is called like that, the
code that called it will get a string value, as it expected, and
happily continue doing something with it. But the value is wrong, so
whatever it ends up doing with it will also be wrong. And if you are
unlucky, this wrongness only causes a problem after having passed
through twenty other functions. In cases like that, it is extremely
hard to find out where the problem started.

In some cases, you will be so unconcerned about these problems that
you don't mind the function misbehaving when given incorrect input.
For example, if you know for sure the function will only be called
from a few places, and you can prove that these places give it decent
input, it is generally not worth the trouble to make the function
bigger and uglier so that it can handle problematic cases.

But most of the time, functions that fail 'silently' are hard to use,
and even dangerous. What if the code calling |between| wants to know
whether everything went well? At the moment, it can not tell, except
by re-doing all the work that |between| did and checking the result of
|between| with its own result. That is bad. One solution is to make
|between| return a special value, such as |false| or |undefined|, when
it fails.

> function between(string, start, end) {
>   var startAt = string.indexOf(start);
>   if (startAt == -1)
>     return undefined;
>   startAt += start.length;
>   var endAt = string.indexOf(end, startAt);
>   if (endAt == -1)
>     return undefined;
>
>   return string.slice(startAt, endAt);
> }

You can see that error checking does not generally make functions
prettier. But now code that calls |between| can do something like:

> var input = prompt("Tell me something", "");
> var parenthesized = between(input, "(", ")");
> if (parenthesized != undefined)
>   print("You parenthesized '", parenthesized, "'.");

---

In many cases returning a special value is a perfectly fine way to
indicate an error. It does, however, have its downsides. Firstly, what
if the function can already return every possible kind of value? For
example, consider this function that gets the last element from an
array:

> function lastElement(array) {
>   if (array.length > 0)
>     return array[array.length - 1];
>   else
>     return undefined;
> }
>
> show(lastElement([1, 2, undefined]));

So did the array have a last element? Looking at the value
|lastElement| returns, it is impossible to say.

The second issue with returning special values is that it can
sometimes lead to a whole lot of clutter. If a piece of code calls
|between| ten times, it has to check ten times whether |undefined| was
returned. Also, if a function calls |between| but does not have a
strategy to recover from a failure, it will have to check the return
value of |between|, and if it is |undefined|, this function can then
return |undefined| or some other special value to its caller, who in
turn also checks for this value.

Sometimes, when something strange occurs, it would be practical to
just stop doing what we are doing and immediately jump back to a place
that knows how to handle the problem.

Well, we are in luck, a lot of programming languages provide such a
thing. Usually, it is called _exception handling_.

---

The theory behind exception handling goes like this: It is possible
for code to _raise_ (or _throw_) an _exception_, which is a value.
Raising an exception somewhat resembles a super-charged return from a
function -- it does not just jump out of the current function, but
also out of its callers, all the way up to the top-level call that
started the current execution. This is called _unwinding the stack_.
You may remember the _stack_ of function calls that was mentioned in
\\cfunctions. An exception zooms down this stack, throwing away all
the call contexts it encounters.

If they always zoomed right down to the base of the stack, exceptions
would not be of much use, they would just provide a novel way to blow
up your program. Fortunately, it is possible to set obstacles for
exceptions along the stack. These '_catch_' the exception as it is
zooming down, and can do something with it, after which the program
continues running at the point where the exception was caught.

An example:

> function lastElement(array) {
>   if (array.length > 0)
>     return array[array.length - 1];
>   else
>     throw "Can not take the last element of an empty array.";
> }
>
> function lastElementPlusTen(array) {
>   return lastElement(array) + 10;
> }
>
> try {
>   print(lastElementPlusTen([]));
> }
> catch (error) {
>   print("Something went wrong: ", error);
> }

_|throw|_ is the keyword that is used to raise an exception. The
keyword _|try|_ sets up an obstacle for exceptions: When the code in
the block after it raises an exception, the _|catch|_ block will be
executed. The variable named in parentheses after the word |catch| is
the name given to the exception value inside this block.

Note that the function |lastElementPlusTen| completely ignores the
possibility that |lastElement| might go wrong. This is the big
advantage of exceptions -- error-handling code is only necessary at
the point where the error occurs, and the point where it is handled.
The functions in between can forget all about it.

Well, almost.

---

Consider the following: A function |processThing| wants to set a
top-level variable |currentThing| to point to a specific thing while
its body executes, so that other functions can have access to that
thing too. Normally you would of course just pass the thing as an
argument, but assume for a moment that that is not practical. When the
function finishes, |currentThing| should be set back to |null|.

> var currentThing = null;
>
> function processThing(thing) {
>   if (currentThing != null)
>     throw "Oh no! We are already processing a thing!";
>
>   currentThing = thing;
>   /* do complicated processing... */
>   currentThing = null;
> }

But what if the complicated processing raises an exception? In that
case the call to |processThing| will be thrown off the stack by the
exception, and |currentThing| will never be reset to |null|.

|try| statements can also be followed by a _|finally|_ keyword, which
means 'no matter *what* happens, run this code after trying to run the
code in the |try| block'. If a function has to clean something up, the
cleanup code should usually be put into a |finally| block:

> function processThing(thing) {
>   if (currentThing != null)
>     throw "Oh no! We are already processing a thing!";
>
>   currentThing = thing;
>   try {
>     /* do complicated processing... */
>   }
>   finally {
>     currentThing = null;
>   }
> }

---

A lot of errors in programs cause the JavaScript environment to raise
an exception. For example:

> try {
>   print(Sasquatch);
> }
> catch (error) {
>   print("Caught: " + error.message);
> }

In cases like this, special error objects are raised. These always
have a |message| property containing a description of the problem. You
can raise similar objects using the |new| keyword and the _|Error|_
constructor:

> throw new Error("Fire!");

---

When an exception goes all the way to the bottom of the stack without
being caught, it gets handled by the environment. What this means
differs between the different browsers, sometimes a description of the
error is written to some kind of log, sometimes a window pops up
describing the error.

The errors produced by entering code in the console on this page are
always caught by the console, and displayed among the other output.

---

Most programmers consider exceptions purely an error-handling
mechanism. In essence, though, they are just another way of
influencing the control flow of a program. For example, they can be
used as a kind of |break| statement in a recursive function. Here is a
slightly strange function which determines whether an object, and the
objects stored inside it, contain at least seven |true| values:

> var FoundSeven = {};
>
> function hasSevenTruths(object) {
>   var counted = 0;
>
>   function count(object) {
>     for (var name in object) {
>       if (object[name] === true) {
>         counted++;
>         if (counted == 7)
>           throw FoundSeven;
>       }
>       else if (typeof object[name] == "object") {
>         count(object[name]);
>       }
>     }
>   }
>
>   try {
>     count(object);
>     return false;
>   }
>   catch (exception) {
>     if (exception != FoundSeven)
>       throw exception;
>     return true;
>   }
> }

The inner function |count| is recursively called for every object that
is part of the argument. When the variable |counted| reaches seven,
there is no point in continuing to count, but just returning from the
current call to |count| will not necessarily stop the counting, since
there might be more calls below it. So what we do is just throw a
value, which will cause the control to jump right out of any calls to
|count|, and land at the |catch| block.

But just returning |true| in case of an exception is not correct.
Something else might be going wrong, so we first check whether the
exception is the object |FoundSeven|, created specifically for this
purpose. If it is not, this |catch| block does not know how to handle
it, so it raises it again.

This is a pattern that is also common when dealing with error
conditions -- you have to make sure that your |catch| block only
handles exceptions that it knows how to handle. Throwing string
values, as some of the examples in this chapter do, is rarely a good
idea, because it makes it hard to recognise the type of the exception.
A better idea is to use unique values, such as the |FoundSeven|
object, or to introduce a new type of objects, as described in \\coo.
